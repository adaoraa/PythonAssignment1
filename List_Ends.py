# Write a program that takes a list of numbers
# (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only
# the first and last elements of the given list.
# For practice, write this code inside a function.


def main(user_list):
    print(user_list[0],user_list[-1])  # # returns first and last elements

main([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])  # calls functions
